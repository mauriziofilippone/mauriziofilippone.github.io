% \section*{Research Activity}
% I started my research career in 2004, in the Department of Computer and Information Sciences at the University of Genova.
% I worked on my Master's thesis in Physics, supervised by Profs. F.~Masulli and S.~Rovetta, on a comparative study of ensembles of learning machines for regression tasks, with a special interest in time series analysis and forecasting.
% The analysis of the time series involved the study of some techniques to estimate the number of past observations needed to obtain a faithful reconstruction of the dynamic of the system (model order).
% A comparative study of some of these methods has been published on the {\em Neural Computing and Applications} journal.
% The studied and implemented ensemble methods were bagging and adaboost using neural networks and SVMs.
% I applied these methods to the tide level forecasting problem in the lagoon of Venice obtaining an improvement in the forecasting accuracy with respect to the methods currently in use.
% The main results have been published in the {\em IJCNN 2007} conference proceedings.

% When I started the Ph.D. in 2005, I focused on clustering problems.
% The main results of my Ph.D. thesis are the following:
% \begin{itemize}
% \item Survey of the literature on kernel and spectral approaches to clustering, reporting the links between them.
% The review has been published as a survey paper on {\em Pattern Recognition} journal, and it has been selected to be the best paper published in 2008 in the journal Pattern Recognition.
% \item Proposing the possibilistic $c$-means in the space induced by positive semidefinite kernels.
% This algorithm is essentially a non parametric estimator of densities in the data space and shows high robustness to outliers.
% I studied its properties in terms of robustness and stability of the solutions, highlighting the connections to One Class SVMs and Kernel Density Estimation.
% These results have been published on {\em IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems}.
% \item Studying the relational clustering when the objects to cluster are described in term of non-metric pairwise dissimilarities.
% This study has been motivated by my experience abroad during the third year at the Information and Software Engineering department at George Mason University.
% I worked on a project founded by NRO, with profs. D.~Barbar\`{a}, C.~Domeniconi, and Z.~Duric, on the detection of suspicious behaviors in reconnaissance images, and I dealt with the clustering problem in the case of non-metric dissimilarities.
% I reported the studies on the algebraic operations transforming the dissimilarities between patterns from non-metric to metric, and I studied the effects of these oprations on many clustering algorithms.
% These studies showed also a direct link between relational clustering and clustering in the space induced by positive semidefinite kernels.
% This part of the thesis has been published as a regular paper in the {\em International Journal of Approximate Reasoning}.
% \end{itemize}

% During these years I also worked on other machine learning related projects, such as dimensionality reduction and biclustering.
% The results of these works have been published in several refereed conference proceedings (LNCS series), one of them has been published as a letter on {\em Neurocomputing}, and another one will appear on {\em International Journal of Knowledge Engineering and Soft Data Paradigms}.
% Typical applications of dimensionality reduction approaches can be found in genomic data analysis, where the number of features is very large with respect to the number of patterns.

% In March 2008 I was Research Associate at the University of Sheffield with the Machine Learning group, supervised by Dr Guido Sanguinetti.
% My research area was on statistical methods for pattern recognition, including both the frequentist and Bayesian paradigms.
% Since the grant that was funding my research activity was about detecting changes in the lifestyle of elderly people to infer changes in their health conditions, much of my studies were on the novelty detection problem.
% We recast the novelty detection problem in the framework of information theory.
% We studied the Gaussian case, showing that the proposed method leads to a statistical test that is able to control the false positive rate on test data even in the case of small training sets.
% Based on this remarkable result, we extended the approach to the mixture of Gaussians and to linear autoregressive time series.
% The results for the Gaussian and mixture of Gaussians cases have been collected in a paper that has been published on {\em Pattern Recognition}, and the extension to autoregressive time-series have been published on the {\em IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing}.
