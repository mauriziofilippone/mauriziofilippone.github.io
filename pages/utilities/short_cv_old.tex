\subsection*{Education}

I received a Master's degree in Physics and a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Genoa, Italy, in 2004 and 2008, respectively.
The reason to pursue a Ph.D. in Computer Science was to deepen my interest in machine learning, which sparked towards the end of my studies in Physics.
I also hold the French abilitation ``Habilitation \'a diriger des recherches'', which is the highest degree in French academic system to allow someone to become a professor.

\subsection*{Research contributions and impact}

My research interest is in the field of Bayesian \ml. 
In the last ten years, I've been focusing on nonparametric Bayesian models based on Gaussian processes, proposing a number of fundamental contributions to their applicability to large-scale problems.
Due to the advancements in the field, myself and other groups working in the domain have established ways to approximate Gaussian processes and Deep Gaussian processes as Bayesian Deep Neural Networks. 
As a result, my research is currently focusing on Bayesian Deep Learning, and techniques at the interface between Gaussian processes and Deep Neural Networks. 

After my Ph.D., I've published 100+ papers almost equally split between journals and conference, and I have been the leading author (either first or last) in most of these.
As of Jan 2022, I've received 3000+ citations and my $h$-index is 26 (source Google Scholar).
